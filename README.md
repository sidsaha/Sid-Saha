# Welcome!

Welcome to Sid Saha's blog. I blog about software creation, adoption, and use. I'm a platform engineer with interests in architecting large scale complex platforms for businesses with multiple business verticals.

I strive to blog about -
* Backend design patterns & architectures
* Tutorials about new technology
* Tips about how to be better at a software developer job (and how to manage and grow teams)
